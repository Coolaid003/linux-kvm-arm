* ARM Timer Watchdog

ARM 11MP, Cortex-A5 and Cortex-A9 are often associated with a per-core
Timer-Watchdog (aka TWD), which provides both a per-cpu local timer
and watchdog.

The TWD is usually attached to a GIC to deliver its two per-processor
interrupts.

Main node required properties:

- compatible : Should be one of:
	"arm,cortex-a9-twd"
	"arm,cortex-a5-twd"
	"arm,arm11mp-twd"
	"arm,smp-twd"

- interrupts : Two interrupts to each core, the first one for the
  timer, the second one for the watchdog.

- reg : Specify the base address and the size of the TWD.

Example:

	twd@2c000600 {
		compatible = "arm,arm11mp-twd", "arm,smp-twd";
		reg = <0x2c000600 0x100>;
		interrupts = <1 13 0xf01 1 14 0xf01>;
	};
